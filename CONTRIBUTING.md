# Contribution Guidelines

Unfortunately, not every library/tool/framework can be considered. This list aims to provide a concise list of noteworthy modern software. This means that suggested software is:

(a) widely recommended, regardless of personal opinion

(b) highly discussed in the community due to its innovative nature

(c) absolutely unique in its approach and function

(d) a niche product that fills a gap

Self-promotion is frowned upon and viewed critically, but your suggestion will of course be approved if the criteria match.

If your entry isn't accepted, please check the [Issues](https://github.com/akullpp/awesome-java/issues) for items marked with the "question" tag to see if it had been previously discussed. If nothing comes up, feel free to create a new issue, adding the "question" tag.

Furthermore, please ensure your pull request follows the following guidelines:

* Please search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
* Please make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
* Use the following format for libraries: \[LIBRARY\]\(LINK\) - DESCRIPTION.
* Entries should be sorted in ascending alphabetical order, i.e. a to z.
* New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
* Keep descriptions short, simple and unbiased.
* End all descriptions with a full stop/period.
* Check your spelling and grammar.
* Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.

Thank you for your suggestions!
